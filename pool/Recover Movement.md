# Recover the Object's Movement

From Task 3, we have obtained the Time-Doppler Spectrum, where Doppler frequecies of all times are obtained. We can get the velocity from them:

$$
v={f_D\cdot c}/f_C, f_C=2123e6
$$

Assume the original displacement $x(0)=0$

$$
x(t)=\int^t_0v(\tau)d\tau
$$

The $v-t$ graph and $x-t$ graph can be obtained from them.

Since we have obtained the spectra of different precisions, we can draw different graphs as follows:

//TODO: figures

Note that the difference among them are very small. We believe that the precision of 2Hz, 0.1s is acceptable.
